Analysis of Cantopop songs with pycantonese
To what extent do the lyrics of Cantopop songs reflect developments in Hong Kong from 1974-2007. A Quantitative lyrical anlaysis of cantopop using big data.

1. Introduction 

As aptly stated by Cantopop's late god-father James Wong 黃霑 "Every generation has its own voice”(Wong 2003,p 182). This statement supports the notion of widely recognised periods of Cantopop, notably; i) the ‘Rise of Cantopop’ in the 1970s, ii) the ‘Age of Glory’ in the 1980s(Chu 2017,p 3), iii) the slow decline in the 1990s and the eventual fall in the 2000s. Each period captures different aspects of Hong Kong's history from  immigration, the end of colonial rule and the rise of regional powers. This essay will employ quantitative lyrical analysis to more rigorously assess to what degree Hong Kong's history has inspired the lyrics of Cantopop. This essay will first present each period i-iii by outlining significant historical developments and recognised trends identified by Cantopop scholars. Following this,  employing the methodology outlined in 2., an investigation as to whether the lyrics of this period reflect the associated developments.  This analysis adds to the growing body of applied quantitative socio-linguistics and is unique in its application to Cantopop. 


2. Methodology

Advances in natural language processing techniques have facilitated deeper understanding and exploration of a vast amount of textual data. Given the desire to investigate broader trends in Cantopop, a selection of these tools are used in the analysis to investigate over 300 Cantopop songs. Utilising the Python programming language, I have automated the collection of lyrics from over 300 top Cantopop hits as ranked by RTHK's Top Ten Chinese Golden Songs Award 十大中文金曲頒獎音樂會 (RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards) (started from 1978) and the Jade Solid Gold Awards  勁歌金曲頒獎典禮 (Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards) (started from 1983). These lyrics will be processed by the PyCantonese tool developed by (Lee 2015). for big data Cantonese Linguistic research. The list of songs collected is located in the appendix, and all data collection and preprocessing code can be found online on Github. The methodology and techniques in this analysis aim to make this type of Cantonese quantitative analysis more accessible for future students and researchers alike.
